## 🚀 Getting Started

Since OpenFlash is a static application, getting it running is super easy. You don't need to install node_modules or build anything!

### Prerequisites

All you need is a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and a text editor (VS Code recommended).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openflash.git
cd openflash
```

### 2. Run the Application

You cannot just double-click `index.html` because of browser security rules (CORS) with JavaScript modules. You need a simple local server.

**Option A: Using Python (Recommended for Mac/Linux)**
```bash
# Run this inside the openflash folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Option B: Using Node.js**
```bash
npx serve
```

### 3. Open in Browser

Visit **`http://localhost:8000`** in your browser. You should see the Landing Page!

## 📂 Project Structure

We keep things organized but simple. Here is how the code is laid out:

```

├── assets/             # Images and static files
├── css/                # Styling files
│   ├── style.css       # Global variables and base styles
│   ├── components.css  # Buttons, cards, and reusable UI
│   ├── landing.css     # Styles specific to the landing page
│   └── toast.css       # Styles for notification popups
└── js/                 # Application logic
    ├── app.js          # 🚦 Main Router: Decides which page to show
    ├── storage.js      # 💾 Database layer: Handles LocalStorage
    ├── toast.js        # 🔔 Notification utility
    ├── utils.js        # 🛠 Helpers: Date formatting, ID generation

## 🛠 How It Works (For Developers)

OpenFlash uses a **Hash-Based Router**.
- When the URL changes to `#/create`, `js/app.js` detects the change.
- It clears the `#app` container in `index.html`.
- It imports `js/views/editor.js` and calls its `render()` function.
- The `render()` function returns a DOM element (HTML), which is appended to the page.

No build tools. No webpack. Just pure, clean JavaScript.
